Hey you! Yeah, you on the other side of the gap, come over here!
#How am I supposed to get over there?
	Jump, stupid. Use those legs that you can still control! Come over here and give me my brain back, and as a gesture of good will, I'll give you a useful hint. It's a real good one too!
	#Sure, shoot!
		Right. Look everywhere for useful stuff; underground, trashcans, the ground... And you can use most of it, combined or separated! And now that I've held up my part of the agreement, get a move on! But be careful around my body, it can be rather... bite-happy.
#Why should I listen to you?
	No reason really. You just don't seem to be up to much at the moment.
	And you are one of the first... brainy... people I've met in a long time. Would be a waste not to try and get some help! 
	#Help?
		Yeah! I've heard some rumors that my condition, or whatever you want to call it, does not have to be permanent! Seems like a thing worthy of some investigation, right? And if you agree to help me, I'll give you a useful hint! And some cables!
		#If you say so...
			Don't sound too enthusiastic about it. The hint is to look everywhere for useful stuff. Trashcans, the ground... And you can use it, combined or separated! And now that I've held up my part of the agreement, jump like yo-... my life depends on it. But be careful around my body, it can be rather... bite-happy.
		#No, not really...
			Well aren't you a cold bastard. I was thinking of giving you some really sweet cables or something, but I guess that's a no.
			#No wait, wait! I'm sorry Mr. Spirit!
				Yeah, that's the spirit! The promised hint, it's a real good one, is to look everywhere for useful stuff. Underground, trashcans, the ground... And you can use most of it, combinated or separated! And now that I've held up my part of the agreement, jump over that gap and come over here and give me my brain back! But be careful around my body, it can be rather... bite-happy.
			#Who would want cables anyway?
				Not you apparently. Everyone loves cables though, there must be something seriously wrong with you. Now, if you're not going to help me, please leave me alone.
	#Brainy?
		Yeah, you know, with your brain still inside your head. Where it kind of needs to be to give you control of your body. And if you agree to help me, I'll give you a useful hint! And some cables!
		#If you say so...
			Don't sound too enthusiastic about it. The hint is to look everywhere for useful stuff. Trashcans, the ground... And you can use it, combined or separated! And now that I've held up my part of the agreement, jump like yo-... my life depends on it. But be careful around my body, it can be rather... bite-happy.
#What even are you?
	A ghost, a spirit, a soul... I don't even know. But I know that there's a possibility for you to help me!
	#Help?
		Yeah! I've heard some rumors that my condition, or whatever you want to call it, does not have to be permanent! Seems like a thing worthy of some investigation, right? And if you agree to help me, I'll give you a useful hint! And some cables!
