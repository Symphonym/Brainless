I used to be really important you know? High up on the ladder of success! Had a job in the government and everything, before this whole city crashed down.
#Wasn't it the governments fault?
	What, no! We just rolled with it like everyone else. Everyone blamed us, but we didn't really do anything.
	#Maybe that's what you did wrong.
		Yeah, maybe. Too late now though, and it's not like the rest of society fared any better you know, with all that mind-numbing media and internet crap I am surprised it didn't happen sooner.
		#You know what caused all this?
			Of course I do, it wasn't really a secret was it? Everyone still remotely in their right mind could see the cause and the spreading.
			#Okay okay, so what was it?
				All that crap that the internet spread, all those harmful norms in society about being part of a whole. There's a lot of people throughout history that's been trying to get people to stop thinking on their own, guess they finally got their wish. But you know, that's all in the past now, too late to do anything about it.
				#Awfully depressing, aren't you?
					Well, I'm also dead, so there's that.
				#It's never too late!
					Aren't you awfully optimistic? Guess that comes with living... Well whatever, that's a chapter in my past. Is there any way I can help you?
					#Yes, what's with the arcade machines?
						I'll tell you. Of course there's a price though, you'll have to get me back in my body.
						#It's a deal!
							Splendid, then listen up! Arcade machines are what those green things to the left of me are called. They are used for entertainment, to fill lonely hours, and to give you are reason to make your friends cry by beating them!
							#Lovely.
								And the best thing is, they never go dark. I don't really want to know where they get their power, surely some dark magic or the tears of children, but it also means that you can still play on them. I've seen games scattered around this whole suburb, try to find them all!
						#What? Aren't you awfully demanding?
							Well alright then, good luck with whatever you're doing with the life you still have.
					#I don't think so.
						Well alright then, good luck with whatever you're doing with the life you still have.
	#I'm sure you did your best.
		Yeah, I like to believe so. It was not like the rest of society fared any better you know, with all that mind-numbing media and internet crap I am surprised it didn't happen sooner.

#Cool.
	Not easily impressed are you? Well, never mind then. Can you at least get me back in my body? This whole floating around in the air thing is getting really tiring.
	#What's in it for me?
		Oh, that's a real business mind you've got there, I'm impressed! If you agree to help me, I'll give you a hint about the arcade machines spread around this suburb. Deal?
		#It's a deal!

		#I can solve this on my own.
			Well alright then, good luck with whatever you're doing with the life you still have.
	#Sure, what do you want me to do?
		You have to get my brain back to my body. In return I'll give you a hint about the arcade machines spread around this suburb. Deal?
