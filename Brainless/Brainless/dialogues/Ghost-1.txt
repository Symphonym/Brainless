That was a nice jump! I almost feel some pride.
#Are you being sarcastic?
	Well, maybe a little, but I mean nothing by it. Let's just say that my people skills are rather rusty. Do you want a repeat of the amazing hint I gave you?
	#Yes, please repeat it.
		Right, here I go! The hint is to look everywhere for useful stuff; underground, trashcans, the ground... And you can use most of it, in combinations or separated! Until you return my brain to me I'll be floating around here, so feel free to come and chat again. It gets rather lonely after a while. And the cables are waiting!
	#No, I can handle myself.
		Well, that's all well and good. Until you return my brain to me I'll be floating around here, so feel free to come and chat again. It gets rather lonely in this half dead, half alive state after a while. And the cables are waiting!
