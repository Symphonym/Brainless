Hey you! Yeah, you on the other side of the gap, come over here!
#How am I supposed to get over there?
	Jump, stupid. Use those legs that you still can control! Come over here and give me my brain back. But watch out for my body over there, it can be rather... bite-happy.
#Why should I listen to you?
	Well, no reason really. You just doesn't seem to be up to much at the moment.
	And you are one of the first... brainy... people I've met in a long time, seems like a waste not to try and get some help! 
	#Help?
		Yeah! I've heard some rumors that my condition, or whatever you want to call it, does not have to be permanent! Seems like a thing worthy of some investigation, right?
		#If you say so...
			Well, don't sound too enthusiastic about it. Then jump! Jump like your life, eh...mine really I guess... depends on it. Go and give my body back its brain! But watch out for my body over there, it can be rather... bite-happy.
		#No, not really...
			Well aren't you a cold bastard. I was thinking of giving you some really sweet cables or something, but I guess that's a no.
			#No wait, wait! I'm sorry Mr. spirit!
				Yeah, that's the spirit! Now jump over that gap and come over here and give me my brain back! But watch out for my body over there, it can be rather... bite-happy.
			#Who would want cables anyway?
				Not you apparently. Everyone loves cables though, there must be something seriously wrong with you. Now, if you're not going to help me, please leave me alone.
	#Brainy?
		Yeah, you know, with your brain still inside you head. Where it kind of needs to be to give you control of your body.
		#If you say so...
			Well, don't sound too enthusiastic about it. Then jump! Jump like your life, eh...mine really I guess... depends on it. Go and give my body back its brain!
#What even are you?
	A ghost, a spirit, a soul... I don't even know. But I know that there's a possibility for you to help me!
	#Help?
		Yeah! I've heard some rumours that my condition, or whatever you want to call it, does not have to be permanent! Seems like a thing worthy of some investigation, right?
		#If you say so...
			Well, don't sound too enthusiastic about it. Then jump! Jump like your life, eh...mine really I guess... depends on it. Go and give my body back its brain! But watch out for my body over there, it can be rather... bite-happy.
