#Of course I have.
	Congratulations, then stop glowering at my spirit and bugger off, I have more important things to do than entertain you.
	#What, like hovering around?
		Damn right. You are just as anoying as everyone was before this whole thing started. Now get lost.
		#Wait just a second, I need your help!
			Too stupid to figure things out by yourself? Here's a hint for ya, the right brain to the right person.
		#You're not exactly mrs. sunshine either.
			That's more like it. Now leave me alone.
	#Even though you are floating around up there you really are a downer.
		Good one! Maybe you're not that bad after all. But that does not change the fact that you should fuck off.
	#Can you please just giv me a hint or something?help me with this problem?
		Too stupid to figure things out by yourself? Here's a hint for ya, the right brain to the right person.
#What's your problem?
	For the moment; you. You expecting some help or something?
	#Yes, that would be nice.
		What a joke, you spoiled brat. Stop glowering and piss off.
