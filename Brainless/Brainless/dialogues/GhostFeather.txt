#...I'm feeling drained all of a sudden.
	You're noticing just now? That's probably you're connection to the other side acting up. 
	#What do you mean?
		Why do you think you're able to see spirits? Seriously, you never thought about that as something strange? You are able to see ghosts! That's not really something normal...
		#Well, it's not as if that's the only abnormal thing that's been happening, now is it?
			Very true. Either way, I guess it's a drain on your body to talk to us that are not really of this world.
			#Aw shit, does that mean I'll lose my ability to see you? I was just beginning to think this was a rather cool ablity and all...
				You're not necessary losing it just yet. Are you into mythology?
				#What? That's a lousy way to change the subject you know, I'm honestly freaking out a little here.
					I'm not changing the subject! Maybe you are aware that there's a lot of myths about ravens and their connection to death and the afterlife?
					#Yeah, sure I am, but I still don't understand what you're getting at.
						Great. So since they are an animal living closer to the line between life and death than any other, and this is something you'll just have to trust me on if you don't believe the myths, they can also help you get your own connection back.
						#And how would that work exactly?
							Their feathers! I've heard that their feathers can help you get in contact with the other side.
							#That sounds... ominous. And stupid, to be honest.
								Well, it's your problem really, not mine... even though it's nice to finally have someone to talk to again.
									#I guess I can give it a shot. I just have to find a feather from a raven right? How hard could that be.
