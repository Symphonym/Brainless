Oh awful fate, to be reduced to a floating... thing. What did I ever do to deserve this?
	#Probably something horrible.
		Who are you to judge me? I've already been punished for all my mortal sins, and more. I deserve better than this. What about my old life? Was all that just a fleeting dream? It feels like a dream now, like a never ending nightmare of braindead people.
		#That's deep.
			I've been told I have a way with words. A gift from a higher power. But that power must have deserted me when I was needing it the most, how else could I end up like this?
				#Why are you so depressing?
					Because my life is all but over, at least for now. I have nothing to keep existing for, no one to really appreciate me.
					Will you help me get out of this dark abyss, back into the light and my body?
					#Sure.
						Terrific, then give me back my brain and I'll give you a gift that'll help you. My lost body is stumbling around over there by the grass, please set me free as soon as possible.
					#You're on your own.
						Then I bid you, and your terrible self, goodbye. May you fall to this curse like the rest of humanity.
				#...Okay, anyway, can you help me?
					Why would I do that? If I do, will you try and save me from this horrible fate?
					#Sure.
						Terrific, then give me back my brain and I'll give you a gift that'll help you. My lost body is stumbling around over there by the grass, please set me free as soon as possible.
					#You're on your own.

		#Yeah that's pretty much what happened.
			You're so blunt, so direct, so unrefined. You should reflect more on how you see life and yourself, and then maybe you will get a shiny soul like mine.
			# It looks just like everyone else's though.
				That's just your ignorance talking, you are blind to the beauty that I'm radiating.
				I cannot suffer your company any longer, please remove yourself from my vicinity.
			# ...Okay, anyway, can you help me?
				Why would I do that? If I do, will you try and save me from this horrible fate?
				#Sure.
					Terrific, then give me back my brain and I'll give you a gift that'll help you. My lost body is stumbling around over there by the grass, please set me free as soon as possible.
				#You're on your own.
					Then I bid you, and your terrible self, goodbye. May you fall to this curse like the rest of humanity.
		#Do you remember how you became like this?
			Bits and pieces, nothing substantial or clear. It was like life ordinarily is in that aspect, you never really notice that things are happening until it's too late. But I guess you are an exception to that, I wonder what makes you special?
			If anyone should be the one spared from this awful fate it should be me. Surely I have more to contribute to the world than you.

	#You alright there?
		No of course I'm not. I'm condemned to this awful fate, to face eternity as a lost soul.
		#Right...
			But it will not last forever, I will be saved by something great! I can feel it. Someone like me cannot be forced to spend their time without their body and without the ability to spread their opinions and talent. Even though all hope seems lost right now, and everyone is even more soulless than what they usually are, I'm sure the human spirit will prevail!
