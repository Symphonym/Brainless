iF i don't leave soon I'll become one of them, one of those brainless... things. My motivation is already waning, I need to stop this while I still can. I can't become like them. Don't really know where to start, where to go. Guess I don't really have a choice either way, either chasing a rumour of a cure or wandering aimlessly.
#If I gave up now, mom and dad would never forgive me. I could use this place as a base, I've been hunkered down here for far too long, it's time to get out there and explore what's become of this place. Let's see how much further our society has decayed, shall we?
