This dark place is more fulfilling than life ever was.
#Winner of 'Most depressing thing to say'..!
	No not really, just the truth! I never really liked the surface anyway. Better here. Down in the dark.
	#I'll just back away slowly now.
		You'll come back. I know it.
#Sure, if you lived in a closet.
	Under some stairs actually.
	#Right... Anyway, do you have some hints for me?
		Hints? For what? How to stay down here, forever surrounded by darkness?
		#No, not really.
			Pity, you're wasting your life running around up on the surface. I have all the friends I need down here; rats, slugs...
			#I'll just back away slowly now.
				You'll come back. I know it.
		#You're nuts.
			And you are disturbing the darkness. Please go away.
